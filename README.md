## 💡 About the Game

AU Edition is a clean, arcade-style shooting game where you control a player at the bottom of the screen.  
Enemies fall from the sky — your job? Shoot 'em before they hit the ground.

Built entirely using Python and Pygame, this game is lightweight, smooth, and packed with essential game dev features.

## 🧠 Behind the Code

Started from scratch. From learning Pygame logic, collision detection, and sound handling —  
to building menus, tracking scores, and managing enemy spawns...  
This game is the result of **relentless learning**, **late-night debugging**, and **real dedication**.

> With the help of ChatGPT and pure focus, everything was built step-by-step from base logic to game polish.
