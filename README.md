# 🎮 Shooting Game - AU Edition

> Built with 💙, late nights, trial & error, and ChatGPT. My first ever game project — no cap.

## 💡 About the Game

This is a **2D shooting game** made using Python and Pygame.  
You're the blue block at the bottom, dodging and blasting enemies falling from the sky.  
Simple? Maybe. Addictive? 100%.

## 🧠 The Story Behind This Project

> Yo! I'm Vikki, and this is my very first coding project.

I started from zero, knew *nothin’* about game dev or Pygame.  
But with **patience, Google, and ChatGPT**, I went from "hello world" to a full-on shooting game.  

I learned:
- Python basics
- Pygame graphics and sounds
- Git and GitHub workflow
- How to *not give up* 😤

This repo = proof that if you’re hungry to learn, you can build ANYTHING.
